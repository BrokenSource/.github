## 💔 Software
We're an **open-source development team** dedicated on making **useful niched software** and cool minor projects

> We code specific tools we long to use and think the world needs, new or libre

**Uniqueness**, **consistency** and **scoping** are core parts of our philosophy, if a piece of code or theory is too complex we attempt to innovate simplifying it

- We build **trust** by being **transparent** and **open** about our code and development process

Our main repository<sup>(a monorepo)</sup> is called [BrokenSource](https://github.com/BrokenSource/BrokenSource), we have a **convenience** clone script and auto dependencies setup, you can **run any project** from there

The main areas we develop for are:

- Computer generated imagery
- Digital signal processing
- Electrical engineering

The name **Broken** _about the Source_ is merely comical in a way to represent the always ongoing war about **code logistics** everyone faces and that pathed its way towards creating this organization and monorepo

`Broken` is also the shared code among all projects, a very bleeding edge library <sub><i>it doesn't care of stability /s!</i></sub>

<sub> Also _Open_ and _Broken_ are somewhat similar on speech 😅 </sub>

## 🔎 Research
When applicable, as a means of lowering the barrier for newcomers and contributing to libre science, we self-publish [papers](https://github.com/BrokenSource/Papers) explaining in readable details the _gotchas_ on the technology we use on our Software

For example, here's some starting ideas of many projects

- Writing an Spectrogram is no easy task converting the raw Fourier Transform to a exponential base 2 frequencies column vector

- Osciloscopes are too expensive? You (already) have a decent one for very cheap and don't know it

- Audio samples library is cluttered? Let's sort them by similarity

- Shunt power factor correction in circuits can be done simply by looking at the impedance, without calculating reactive power

- Why to break Newton-Raphson power flow equations into real and imaginary components creating complexity with nearly identical formulas? Let's do it in phasor form!

Our mission is to put an end these problems and annoyances; and to put to use experimental theories for fixing them while also sharing the knowledge
